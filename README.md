A few projects with MRI and X-ray CT imaging that I have done. SENSE, GRAPPA, and linear CT reconstruction are included.

The CT reconstruction algorithm here attempts to impliment the 'radon' and 'iradon' functions in MATLAB using only the 'imrotate' function.

Undergraduate and graduate students with assignments to impliment these algorithms may find this page useful.

Please convert the .m files to the .mlx (MATLAB live script) format for a better viewing experience. These files were designed for .mlx files.
